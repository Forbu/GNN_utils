# GNN_utils

This repository contains GNN (graph neural network) architecture. Those are full GNN architecture.
We have 2 kind of architecture :

    - MeshGraphNets use in https://paperswithcode.com/method/meshgraphnet
    
    - We also adapt this architecture using GAT (graph attention Network https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.10903)

Those architecture are "full" architecture and does not contains only GNN layers.

In gnn_utils/ we have the models.py which contains the MPGNN adapt with GAT layers.

We also have an MPGNN architecture in the gnn_utils/models_mpgnn.py
